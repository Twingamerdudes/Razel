## Introduction
Razel is a game engine I made for the tool jam 2, here is it's itch page: https://twingamerdudes.itch.io/razel. It is menat to make games in cpp easier to make. It handles many stuff for you like textures, text rendering, collsion, and more!
## Compiling
So you want to modify Razel's source, well it's easy!
First get visual studio 2019 with desktop app development with cpp enabled. Next load up the project in vs.
After that right click the Razel project and click build (you can also do this to the Sandbox project).
